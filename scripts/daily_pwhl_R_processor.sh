# Pulling BEFORE staging can only abort: the build has just rewritten tracked
# parquet/csv/json, so `git pull` refuses with "Your local changes would be
# overwritten by merge". The old form then committed anyway, pushed into a
# non-fast-forward rejection, and swallowed it -- a GREEN job that published
# nothing (wehoop-wnba-data 32192069433/32192069566, hoopR-nba-data 32204419012).
#
# Stage and commit FIRST so the tree is clean, then reconcile. `rebase --merge`
# rather than `pull --rebase`: the default am backend base64-encodes every blob
# it replays, which crawls on these binary-asset repos.
