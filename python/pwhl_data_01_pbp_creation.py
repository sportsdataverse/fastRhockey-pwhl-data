"""Stage 01 — pwhl `pbp` season dataset (parse + compile ONE family).

Thin numbered entry over ``pwhl_data_build.season`` restricted to the ``pbp``
family (``--families pbp`` injected; remaining args forward verbatim).
Single home for the family list: the config DATASETS registry — these
stages are generated from it. Publish is the final numbered stage.

Usage::

    python -m pwhl_data_01_pbp_creation -s 2026
    scripts/pwhl_data.sh 01
