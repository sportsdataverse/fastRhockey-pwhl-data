"""Stage 07 — pwhl `game_rosters` season dataset (parse + compile ONE family).

Thin numbered entry over ``pwhl_data_build.season`` restricted to the ``game_rosters``
family (``--families game_rosters`` injected; remaining args forward verbatim).
Single home for the family list: the config DATASETS registry — these
stages are generated from it. Publish is the final numbered stage.

Usage::

    python -m pwhl_data_07_game_rosters_creation -s 2026
    scripts/pwhl_data.sh 07
